## 📌 Project Overview

**Campus Issue Tracker (FixMyCampus)** is a web-based facility management application designed to eliminate paper logs, informal messages, and untracked complaints across educational institutions. 

The application is deployed on **Render Cloud** and utilizes **Cloudinary** for image storage and asset optimization, providing instant access from any device.

### 🌟 Key Highlights:
* ☁️ **Hosted on Render:** Containerized and continuously deployed on Render's cloud infrastructure for high availability.
* 📸 **Cloudinary Cloud Storage:** High-speed cloud photo storage and CDN delivery for all uploaded issue evidence.
* 🤖 **AI-Powered Reporting:** Integrated conversational AI assistant and multilingual voice translation to auto-fill ticket details.
* 👥 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Customized dashboards for Students, Faculty, Maintenance Teams, and Administrators.
* ⚡ **Live Status Tracking:** Real-time visibility through the entire lifecycle (`Pending` ➔ `In Progress` ➔ `Resolved` ➔ `Closed`).
